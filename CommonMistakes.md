#Common mistakes encountered on building the project

Not loaded google fonts: unfortunately went offline

SASS Not compiling frequently : untill go and give save to main.scss

Flex Properties:

shorthand used wrongly : flex-basis instead of flex;

object - fit works when both width and height properties set

missing .svg while filling name cause not rendering of svg
`<use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-map"></use>`

setting auto only the required direction 
eg., margin-right instead of margin.

while drawing border bottom, missing to specify all value to properties.
eg., `border-bottom : 1px solid #fff` But wrongly mentioned only color as `border-bottom: #fff`
